              <h3>Common mistake while writing seo title tag:</h3>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>1. Missing title tag:</b> Many of website creators sometimes forget to write title tag for webpage. In this case Google write the title tag for them and it may use any part of the content present in the webpage. It is not necessary that google will write good title for us. So don't forget to write title tag.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>2. Duplicate title:</b> Duplicate title means if more than one webpage of a website have same title. It may decrease your ctr and bad user experience for your audience. So always try to write unique title for every webpage.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>3. keyword stuffing:</b> Don't just stuff keywords into your title tag, Sometimes people use keyword randomly in the title tag to increase ctr. But it is not a good practice in seo, Always use keywords in such a way so that it looks natural when user read it.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>4. Multiple target keywords:</b> Sometimes people use so many keywords in title tag to cover all the topics present in the webpage. But it will not increase your ranking and user will not click to your link. So if you have more topics try to seperate them in different webpages and after that you can write title for individual webpages.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>5. Unrelevancy:</b> Your title tag should be the perfect idea of content present in your webpage. But sometimes people mistakely write totally irrelevant title for their webpage. In such a condition user cannot get the idea of your webpage and may skip your link in the serp.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>6. Brand Name Usage:</b> Google suggest to write your title in 60-70 characters. But when we use our brand or company name in title tag it can take 30-40% space and restrict us to write more detailed title. So don't use your company name until its necessary. This will allow you to write more detailed title and help your audience for better understanding of your webpage.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>7. Long title:</b> As above I told you Google suggest the length of title tag should be between 60-70 characters. If you write long title more than 60-70 characters , Google will cutoff the extra portion. It may possible that some important words will remove. So always keep it in mind and write the title tag between 60-70 characters for better practice in seo.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>8. Repeated keywords:</b> Sometimes people use their main keyword in title tag many times to increase ctr. But its not a good practice in seo. It will harm your ranking in google. So don't repeat keywords in title tag.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>9. Don't use caps:</b> Capital letters take more space than the small letters. So its a good practice in seo to write maximum part of title tag in lowercase. It will allow you to write more longer title.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>10. Use symbols:</b> You can use symbols instead of words. This will save some space, In this way you can write more longer title.<br>For example: You can use "&" symbol instead of word "and".</p>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>11. Don't write once:</b> Don't think that if you ranked good for a particular title you will never rank down. Remember that google algorithm is continuosly changing also your competitors may rank up to you. So it is necessary to work regularly on your title tag to maintain your ranking.</p>

              <h3>Explaination how competitor backlink analysis technique works:</h3>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>1. Find Your Right Competitors:</b> The first step in this process to know who is your right competitor. For this you just need to search your keyword for which you want to rank. After searching you have to copy 3-5 cometitors domain name and paste into a spreadsheet. Remember that the competitors must have high DA , good number of backlinks and less spammy.</p>
                <p>For example: If we want to rank our blog for keyword "best keyword research tools" then once you searched this keyword, results will show as below. You can choose your top competitors here.</p>
                <div class="sbs-img">
                  <img src="{{asset('assets/img/blog/backlink/cba/1.PNG')}}" class="img-fluid">
                </div><br><br>
                <p>Now you can create spreadsheet and put 3-5 competitors with high DA, good number of backlinks and low spam rate. These metrics is showing along with results because I have installed a chrome extension "keyword everywhere". I have created spreadsheet shown as below:</p>
                <div class="sbs-img">
                  <img src="{{asset('assets/img/blog/backlink/cba/1.2.PNG')}}" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
                <div class="visit-link">
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>2. Check Your Competitor Backlink:</b> After creating first spreadsheet you have to get the list of your competitor backlinks. For this you can use a free tool and export the backlinks list. Remember that in this list you have to consider only relevant and good quality backlinks.</p>
                <p>For example: If I want to get the backlinks of one of my competitor. for that I will click "show backlinks" option below competitor domain name in serp. This option will only show if you have installed "keyword everywhere". Here you can also export this data in excel sheet.</p>
                <div class="sbs-img">
                  <img src="{{asset('assets/img/blog/backlink/cba/2.PNG')}}" class="img-fluid">
                </div><br><br>
                <p>Below sheet I have downloaded from there. In this sheet you can check all backlinks for your that competitor.</p>
                <div class="sbs-img">
                  <img src="{{asset('assets/img/blog/backlink/cba/2.2.PNG')}}" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
                <div class="sbs-img">
                </div>
                <div class="visit-link"></div>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>3. Get A Link From Your Competitor Backlink:</b> Once you have the competitors backlinks list. You can approach them(from where your competitor is getting backlink) and can ask for a backlink, Inexchange of anything what you can do for them.</p>
                <p>For example: You can offer a free service that your business have, or you can write an article for them or promote their business on your site or may be anything else.</p>
                <p>In this way you can get good quality backlinks. This is the right approach to get the backlinks from your competitors backlinks.</p>
                <div class="sbs-img">
                </div>
                <div class="visit-link"></div>
              </div>
              <div class="single-blogs-steps">
                <p><b>4. Repeat This Until You have good number of backlinks:</b> Try to approach for 5-7 backlinks daily. And repeat This process atleast for 5-6 months. I know this is very boring process but it is the right way to get quality backlinks. If you are looking for any shortcut to achieve backlinks then I think you can choose a wrong way so remember that there is no shortcut to gain backlinks. You have to spend time for getting quality backlinks.</p>
